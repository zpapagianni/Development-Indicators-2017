# Development Indicators 2017
 Analysis and Clustering

## Introduction
The purpose of this report is to delve into the World Bank's data, which is available at [https://data.worldbank.org/1] and contains the 2017 values of a selection of 'global development indicators' for 68 countries. Each observation is associated with a single country. The goal of this study is to assess and compare country development, investigate correlations between different indicators, and identify possible homogeneity between countries. This report begins by assessing the data's quality before proceeding to a univariate and multivariate analysis. This will be used to aid in determining any clustering behaviour, which will then be investigated further using various dimension reduction and clustering methods.
